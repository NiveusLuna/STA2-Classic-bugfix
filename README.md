 Bugfixes for the Fleet Ops mod STA2 Classic

There exists a standalone mod for Fleet Ops that aims to reimport the original
Star Trek: Armada II assets into Fleet Ops and recreate the original game. This
would have the benefit of greater stability and the other improvements that
come with the Fleet Ops engine. This is not that mod.

This is an addon for that mod that fixes bugs in the ODFs. I made it a separate
modpack so that it's easier to arrange games with other people, should anyone
actually want to actually play with me. I'm publishing it in case someone else
wants my fixes.

Bugs fixed:

- Cardassian cargo ship does not cloak
	- May have been missing in stock A2 as well, but the manual's hotkey
	  section lists it as having a cloak
- Cardassian sensor station uses Klingon cloak detection technology
- Cardassian Brinok, Galor, and Keldon all use the same plasma torpedoes
- Repair ships on high autonomy do not get nearly close enough to repair things
